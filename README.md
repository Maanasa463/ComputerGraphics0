# ComputerGraphics0
### This was the first assignment in the Computer Graphics course to familiarise oneself with the OpenGL environment.

Commands to run the program are:
```
cd build
```
```
./app <num_sides>
```

Where <num_sides> is an integer.

* A prism is then rendered on screen with the given number of sides.
* Each face of the prism/pyramid has a unique colour.
* Movement of camera is controlled as follows:
    * Key `W` moves it forward and `S` moves it backward.
    * Key `A` moves it left and `D` moves it right.
    * Key `Q` moves it up and `E` moves it down.
    * The camera always faces the prisms center.
* Movement of object is controlled as follows:
    * Key `U` moves it forward and `J` moves it backward.
    * Key `K` moves it right and `H` moves it left.
    * Key `I` moves it down and `Y` moves it up.
    * Press and hold key `R` ro rotate it.
* Key `T` toggles between the prism and a pyramid.
    * The commands for controlling the pyramid are the same as that of the prism.
